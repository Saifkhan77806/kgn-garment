          Founded in the year 2000, KGN Garment began with a simple vision — to
          bring the elegance of traditional Indian attire into the modern
          wardrobe. What started as a humble tailoring unit soon grew into a
          full-scale manufacturing and wholesale brand, recognized for its
          dedication to quality and detail.

          Every Nehru jacket we produce reflects a perfect harmony between
          heritage craftsmanship and contemporary design. Our skilled artisans
          use fine fabrics, precision stitching, and careful finishing to ensure
          every jacket embodies sophistication and comfort.
        </p>

          Today, we proudly serve clients across India, fulfilling bulk and
          custom orders for weddings, events, and corporate gatherings. With
          over two decades of experience, our story is not just about garments —
          it’s about passion, precision, and pride in every stitch.
